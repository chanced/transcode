# why is a yaml/json conversion library

why encodes yaml into json and vice versa while preserving the order and structure of the data.

-   aliases are not supported.
-   comments are obviously lost
-   strings are currently placed into a single line
-   testing is incredibly lacking. I'll get around to it.

Open sourcing it incase anyone needs it. Please feel free to open issues or contribute if you feel so inclined.
